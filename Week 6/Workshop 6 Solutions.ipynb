    "We can add vectors (assuming they live in the same space $\\mathbb{R}^n)$, and we can make scalar multiples of vectors.  Combining these two operations gives us *linear combinations*.  Given some vectors $\\vec{v}_1, \\ldots, \\vec{v}_k$ and numbers (or scalars) $c_1, \\ldots, c_k$, we make the linear combination\n",

    "\n",
    "Inside $\\mathbb{R}^n$, any set that we make by taking the span of a collection of vectors is a **linear subspace** (sometimes alternatively called a vector subspace or just a subspace).  For example, the span of \n",
    "$$\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0\\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\text{ and } \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0\\end{pmatrix}$$\n",

Such a linear combination is called a **linear dependence relation**.  An equivalent way to say this is that one of the vectors can be produced as a linear combination of the others.  \n",

    "For example, the vectors $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix}$ are linearly dependent because \n",
